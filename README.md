1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)

This app is to pull information from multiple apis and store the info retrieved.

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized

liri.js holds the javascript code that is run on Node.  key.js holds the api keys to the api server.  package.json holds the infomation that will be pulled from api's and what will be stored.

3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app

I am unclear as to when the packages are to be installed and what they are for.  I know they go before you run the javacript on node.js. to run the app you run the liri file in node by typing in node liri.js

4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning

5. Contain a link to a deployed version of the app

6. Clearly list the technologies used in the app

javascript api node.js

7. State your role in the app development

I developed the app with help in tutoring by Armando.
